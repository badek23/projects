    """
    Welcome to AI and Big Data in Business Strategy! This course is an AI-driven experience. Throughout this course 
    you will dive deeply into artificial intelligence and machine learning. Together, we will learn about the value 
    proposition of AI, how to put AI into operation in businesses, the challenges of implementing AI, and much more. 
    The best way to learn about a topic is to immerse yourself in it. Therefore, to learn about AI, you will be assisted 
    by your new best friend, Alex, a machine learning bot. Alex knows just about everything (except, perhaps, the 
    meaning of life.) Click on to the next page to begin chatting with him.
