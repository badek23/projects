# Customer Segmentation

### About this project
This project was originally built in a professional setting, which is why the script itself cannot be shared. The goal was to define a customer segmentation prioritization framework, to track where in the company these customers existed, and to understand what differentiates these customers. The project was split into two phases: (1) utilizing SQL to combine, filter, cut, and verify customer, product, and sales data from throughout the company, and (2) utilizing Tableau to create interactive, flexible visuals of this data. The final SQL script was several thousand lines long. The Tableau dashboards automatically refreshed monthly and pulled directly from Vertica databases, so visuals were consistently and automatically refreshed with updated data. The dashboards included drop-down menus that allowed customization of included data, heat maps to quickly understand comparative values, and double-clicks into topics of particular interest.

### Technologies 
The first stage of this project was in SQL and the second stage was in Tableau.

### Challenges
I began this project soon after my first exposure to SQL, and suddenly found myself scripting almost all day, every day, for several months. This project was therefore a massive learning curve for me and greatly increased my confidence in SQL. The biggest challenge for this project was that the datasets I wanted to utilize had never been combined before, so I had to test different methods for obtaining the required data, ensure data quality and definitional integrity, and collaborate with stakeholders across the entire company. Additionally, I had never utilized Tableau before this project, so I had to figure out how to automate processes and build out the project requirements. This project was an invaluable analytical opportunity and had a lot of impact on the company!
